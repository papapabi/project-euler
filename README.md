# Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/ "Project Euler's website") is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. Problems are of varying difficulty but each is solvable, as they say, in less than a minute using an efficient algorithm on a modestly-powered computer.<sup>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Euler]</sup>

This repository is a collection of all my solutions to said problems.

**Open these files at your own risk** (unless you're viewing them for hiring purposes). If you plan to solve these problems on your own, I highly suggest not checking these solutions out, as it would surely influence how you'd go about solving them yourself. Real learning is an active process, and seeing how it is done is a long way from experiencing that epiphany of discovery.

## How to run the files
To execute the files, simply clone this repository and type:
```
$ ruby <problem_number>.rb
```
The program will output the solution for Problem <problem_number>, and the time it took to find  that solution.

## Example ouptut
```
$ ruby 21.rb
The sum of all amicable numbers under 10,000 is 31626
Time elapsed (in seconds):   0.220000   0.010000   0.230000 (  0.267515)
